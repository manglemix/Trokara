## General info
Ever wanted to make a shooter, but end up creating something buggy and not fun to play?
Or even worse, your code looks practically like an Italian dinner, and your teammates hate you for that?
Well you're in luck! The brunt of any FPS, TPS, platformers etc has been done for you!
The set of scripts in TrokaraScripts is available free of any royalty, for anyone from beginners to professionals, to use

There is a demo available, with assets courtesy of mstuff
In the demo, pressing 1 switches to FPS, whilst pressing 2 switches to TPS
The important thing to note is that both demos use the same script for the KinematicBodies
The only thing which is different is the cameras, the scripts for which are also available

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
There are still features which can be added by others, and probably a few bugs which haven't appeared yet
This project is completely open-source so anyone can contribute

## Inspiration
It all began when my previous project, a third person platformer, went bust. A guy by the name of mstuff asked for someone to help develop a third person controller in discord. I responded, as I was kind of pleased with what I had made before, and wanted to prove it. After many weeks of coding, the final product was very different than from the failed project, yet was much better and cleaner.
